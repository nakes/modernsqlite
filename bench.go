//    glibc includes corresponding *f128 interfaces for it.  The required
//    libgcc support was added some time after the basic compiler
//    support, for x86_64 and x86.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1 and the type is ABI-distinct
//    from the default float, double and long double types in this glibc.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for _Float64x, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *f64x interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1 and _Float64x has the format
//    of long double.  Otherwise, if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1, _Float64x has
//    the format of _Float128, which must be different from that of long
//    double.

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _Float128
//    types, if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// Defined to a complex binary128 type if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

// long double is distinct from double, so there is nothing to
//    define here.

// This header should be included at the bottom of each bits/floatn.h.
//    It defines the following macros for each _FloatN and _FloatNx type,
//    where the same definitions, or definitions based only on the macros
//    in bits/floatn.h, are appropriate for all glibc configurations.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for this type, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *fN or *fNx interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding __HAVE_<type> macro is 1 and the
//    type is the first with its format in the sequence of (the default
//    choices for) float, double, long double, _Float16, _Float32,
//    _Float64, _Float128, _Float32x, _Float64x, _Float128x for this
//    glibc; that is, if functions present once per floating-point format
//    rather than once per type are present for this type.
//
//    All configurations supported by glibc have _Float32 the same format
//    as float, _Float64 and _Float32x the same format as double, the
//    _Float64x the same format as either long double or _Float128.  No
//    configurations support _Float128x or, as of GCC 7, have compiler
//    support for a type meeting the requirements for _Float128x.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding _FloatN type is not binary compatible
//    with the corresponding ISO C type in the current compilation unit as
//    opposed to __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOATN, which indicates the default types built
//    in glibc.

// Defined to 1 if any _FloatN or _FloatNx types that are not
//    ABI-distinct are however distinct types at the C language level (so
//    for the purposes of __builtin_types_compatible_p and _Generic).

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _FloatN
//    or _FloatNx types, if __HAVE_<type> is 1.  The corresponding
//    literal suffixes exist since GCC 7, for C only.

// Defined to a complex type if __HAVE_<type> is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

// If double, long double and _Float64 all have the same set of
//    values, TS 18661-3 requires the usual arithmetic conversions on
//    long double and _Float64 to produce _Float64.  For this to be the
//    case when building with a compiler without a distinct _Float64
//    type, _Float64 must be a typedef for long double, not for
//    double.

// The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE

//    of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
//    We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
//    variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.
//
// 	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
// 	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
// 	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
// 	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
// 	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
// 	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
// 	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long
//
//    We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
//    conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
//    types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
//    This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
//    these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
//    make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
//    we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
//    compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
//    and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
//    program's portability.
//
//    Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
//    we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
//    and int is always 32 bits.

// Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
//    wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
//    the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.

// This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.
//    There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.

// Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
//    Just ignore it.

// On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
//    _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
//    vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
//    not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
//    If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
//    invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.

// In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
//    GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
//    __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
//    parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
//    include gstddef.h, such as collect2.

// This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.

// Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.

// On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
//    _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the

//    not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
//    If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
//    invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.

// In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
//    GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
//    __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the

// against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
//
// If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
// may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
// only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
// is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to NULL.
//
// The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
// [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
// The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
// flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
// and not its inode needs to be synced.

// xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
// The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
// either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
// PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
// if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
//
// The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
// VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
// [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
// integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
// point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
// write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
// functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
// locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
// about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
// core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
// A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
// Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
// greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should

// CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
//
// An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
// the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
// in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
// the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
//
// The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
// the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
// is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
// SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
// with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
// to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
// may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
// may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
// Note that due to an oversight, the structure
// of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
// SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
// and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
//
// The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
// structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
// a pathname in this VFS.
//
// Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
// the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
// and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
// in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
// searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
// implementation should use the pNext pointer.
//
// The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
// structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
// or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
// The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
// object once the object has been registered.
//
// The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
// be unique across all VFS modules.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
// ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
// is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
// from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
// ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
// consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
// 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
// ^SQLite further guarantees that
// the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
// called. Because of the previous sentence,
// the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
// filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
// If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
// must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
// xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
// flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
//
// The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
// the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
// or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
// [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
// If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
// include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
//
// ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
// call, depending on the object being opened:
//
// <ul>
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
// </ul>)^
//
// The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
// change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
// that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
// the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
// also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
// order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
//
// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
// </ul>
//
// The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
// deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
// databases, and subjournals.

// CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
//
// An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
// the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
// in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
// the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
//
// The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
// the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
// is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
// SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
// with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
// to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
// may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
// may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
// Note that due to an oversight, the structure
// of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
// SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
// and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
//
// The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
// structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
// a pathname in this VFS.
//
// Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
// the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
// and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
// in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
// searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
// implementation should use the pNext pointer.
//
// The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
// structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
// or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
// The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
// object once the object has been registered.
//
// The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
// be unique across all VFS modules.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
// ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
// is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
// from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
// ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
// consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
// 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
// ^SQLite further guarantees that
// the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
// called. Because of the previous sentence,
// the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
// filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
// If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
// must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
// xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
// flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
//
// The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
// the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
// or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
// [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
// If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
// include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
//
// ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
// call, depending on the object being opened:
//
// <ul>
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
// </ul>)^
//
// The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
// change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
// that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
// the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
// also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
// order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
//
// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
// </ul>
//
// The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
// deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
// databases, and subjournals.
//
// ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
// with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly

// get as many WHERE clause terms into the form shown above as possible.
// ^The aConstraint[] array only reports WHERE clause terms that are
// relevant to the particular virtual table being queried.
//
// ^Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
// ^Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
//
// The colUsed field indicates which columns of the virtual table may be
// required by the current scan. Virtual table columns are numbered from
// zero in the order in which they appear within the CREATE TABLE statement
// passed to sqlite3_declare_vtab(). For the first 63 columns (columns 0-62),
// the corresponding bit is set within the colUsed mask if the column may be

// to the right of the first 63 is required, then bit 63 of colUsed is also

//
// ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,

// in multithreaded applications.
//
// ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
// call to xShutdown().
//
// [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
// ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
// SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
// though this is not guaranteed. ^The
// first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
// be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The

// associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
// a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
// extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
// database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
// on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
// ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
// created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
// false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
// does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
// it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
// never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
// ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
// false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
// ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
// never contain any unpinned pages.
//
// [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
// ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
// suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
// instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
// the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
// parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
// value; it is advisory only.
//
// [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
// The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
// stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
//
// [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
// The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to
// an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
// The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
// pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a
// single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
// a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
// for each entry in the page cache.
//
// The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
// is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
// to be "pinned".
//
// If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
// implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
// intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
// cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
// parameter to help it determined what action to take:
//
// <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
// <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
// <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
// <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
//                 Otherwise return NULL.
// <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
//                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
// </table>
//
// ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
// will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
// failed.)^  In between the xFetch() calls, SQLite may
// attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
// pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
//
// [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
// ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
// as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
// then the page must be evicted from the cache.
// ^If the discard parameter is
// zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
// page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
// may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
//
// The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single
// call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls
// to xFetch().
//
// [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
// The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
// page passed as the second argument. If the cache
// previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
// discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
// to be pinned.
//
// When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
// existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal

// of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
// they can be safely discarded.
//
// [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
// ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
// All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After

// CAPI3REF: Application Defined Page Cache.
// KEYWORDS: {page cache}
//
// ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
// register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an
// instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
// In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by
// SQLite is used for the page cache.
// By implementing a
// custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
// the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which
// that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to
// determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for
// how long.
//
// The alternative page cache mechanism is an
// extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
// The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
//
// ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
// internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
// the application may discard the parameter after the call to
// [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
//
// [[the xInit() page cache method]]
// ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective
// call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
// (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
// method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
// The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures
// required by the custom page cache implementation.
// ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the
// built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
// page cache.)^
//
// [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
// ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
// It can be used to clean up
// any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
// ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
//
// ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
// so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
// xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
// not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
// in multithreaded applications.
//
// ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
// call to xShutdown().
//
// [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
// ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
// SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
// though this is not guaranteed. ^The
// first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
// be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
// second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage
// associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
// a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
// extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
// database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
// on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
// ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
// created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
// false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
// does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
// it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
// never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
// ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
// false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
// ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
// never contain any unpinned pages.
//
// [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
// ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
// suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
// instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
// the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
// parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
// value; it is advisory only.
//
// [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
// The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
// stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
//
// [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
// The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to
// an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
// The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
// pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a
// single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
// a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
// for each entry in the page cache.
//
// The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
// is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
// to be "pinned".
//
// If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
// implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
// intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
// cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
// parameter to help it determined what action to take:
//
// <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
// <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
// <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
// <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
//                 Otherwise return NULL.
// <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
//                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
// </table>
//
// ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
// will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
// failed.)^  In between the xFetch() calls, SQLite may
// attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
// pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
//
// [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
// ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
// as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
// then the page must be evicted from the cache.
// ^If the discard parameter is
// zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
// page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
// may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
//
// The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single
// call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls
// to xFetch().
//
// [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
// The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
// page passed as the second argument. If the cache
// previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
// discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
// to be pinned.
//
// When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
// existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
// to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
// of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
// they can be safely discarded.
//
// [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
// ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
// All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
// calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
// handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
// functions.
//
// [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
// ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
// free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
// is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
// do their best.
